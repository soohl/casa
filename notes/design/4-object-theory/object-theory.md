# 1. Object Theory

## 1.1. Paradigms of Design
* Procedural
* Object-Oriented
* Functional 
* Logic

## 1.2. Goal of OO
* Find a better way to modularize large programs by hiding the details
* Find a better way to reuse software
* Find a better way to understand large systems through abstraction

## 1.3. OO Mantra
* Objects do the work. The work is done in instance methods in the appropriate class. Good objects have clear, cohesive roles, responsibilities and clear focused interfaces.
* Budd: OOP is structured as a community of interacting agents called objects. Each object has a role to play. Each object provides a service or perfoems an action used by other members of the community. 

## 1.4. What is Object?
* Knows information
* Performs service
* Maintains connections
* Makes decisions

## 1.5. OO Characteristics
* Identity 
* Encapsulation
* Polymorphism

## 1.6. OO Term
* Class/Object
* Instance
* Message
* Receiver
* Class Hierarchy
* Inheritance
* Overriding/Overloading
* Polymorphism
* Encapsulation
* Abstraction
* Information Hiding
