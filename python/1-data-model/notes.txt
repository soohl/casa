Special method when we want our object to support and interact with fundamental language constructs: 

For example, collections[key] is actually collections.__getitem__(key) 
* Collections
* Attribute access
* Iteration
* Operator overloading
* Function and method invocation
* String representation and formatting
* Async programming using await
* Object creation and destruction
* Managed context using the with or async with statements

These __XX__() functions are often called special method or magic method

len() is not a special method since len() on built-in type is implemented directly 
by C backend for efficient operation. We can still implment __len__() to make len
work on custom objects
